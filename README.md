# GuessingGame


The GuessingGame is a windowed app complete with a text field for the user’s guess, a button to submit the guess, and a label that tells the user if they’ve guessed too high, too low, or correctly.

When the program runs, it presents a visual interface that users will interact with. 

The GUI version allows the user to play the game in a desktop window.
